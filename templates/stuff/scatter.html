    <h1 align = "center" = >Scatter Matrix</h1>
 
<p>
  Scatter Matrix also known as scatter plot, easily quantifies which variables/ attributes are correlated with others.
  It is usually an indication of good information content. It can be used to determine whether the variables are correlated and whether
   the correlation is positive or negative.

    <p >This scatter plot gives us the histogram for the distributions along the diagnol and a lot of 2D scatter plots off-diagnol. 
        Some variables have a lot of scatter and some are correlated i.e there is a direction in their scatter which leads us to correlation plots.
