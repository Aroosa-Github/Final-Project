 <h3>What is a 3D scatter plot?</h3>
<p>
    Generally 3D scatter plot is created by using ax. scatter3D() the function of the matplotlib library which accepts a data sets 
    of X, Y and Z to create the plot while the rest of the attributes of the function are the same as that of two dimensional scatter plot.

    To have a probabilistic analysis of our data,a simple approach might be just to use the top correlated variables and investigate them further.
    
    In our case we have selected Glucose, BMI and Age.
    
    'Pregnancies' are not included because we are not paying attention to gender.

    The figure shows a 3D scatter plot for diabetic and non-diabtic patients.The red dots indicate non diabetic individuals
    whereas the blue dots indicates diabetic individuals. It's hard to seperate the dots even if you look from any angle.
    In this figure x= glucose, y = BMI and z = age.
